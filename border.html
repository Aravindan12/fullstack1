    A paragraph is a series of related sentences developing a central idea, called the topic.<br> 
        Try to think about paragraphs in terms of thematic unity: a paragraph is a sentence or a <br>
        group of sentences that supports one central, unified idea. Paragraphs add one idea at a<br>
         time to your broader argument.<br>
